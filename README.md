# CSC322: C Programming and Unix
Instructor: Dr. Stefan Wuchty, Fall 2015

"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
    -Issac Newton
  
This class will introduce the student to using commands on the terminal, 
creating shellscripts, and basic C functions and libraries.

NOTE: Please refrain from copying code. Try to work out the lab tasks. 
If you're stuck, ask the TA for help. Else if that doesn't work, search for 
answers to your specific problem on Stack Overflow or StackExchange. Else, 
post a question on those sites. 

CSC120 and CSC220 focused on object oriented programming in Java. 
C is radically different: it has no "objects". And there is no IDE like
Eclipse that compiles and executes files for you. Here, code must be compiled
and executables launched via the command line. Little changes to get used to. 
After a while, you'll find that the command line creates, deletes, and finds 
files faster than a graphical interface can. 

This class may seem tedious at times: familiar data types and logical operations
might cause you to wonder why the basics are being repeated. Well, C teaches 
the building blocks of functions and data structures that are taken for granted
in higher programming languages like Java. Basic functions in Java such as 
toString() and parseInt() are just called for when they are needed, but it's 
good to know how these functions work and being able implement them every once 
in a while. 

The more programming one does, the more one realizes the truth of Issac Newton's
words: "If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
Everyday, whether we code or not, we are using an invention that someone before
us created. Our current world is simply a compound of these small but successive
improvements. By coding in C, one can gain a newfound appreciation for the guys
who made Java and its libraries of specialized methods. And if you ever wanna be
really grateful for C, try learning Assembly.

This class can be pretty funny at times. Some of the command names remind us that
the UNIX gurus were just like us at some point: hormone-driven teens who enjoyed
a tinge of lewd humor. 

Good Luck! Make the most of your college experience.
