# CSC322: C Programming and Unix
Instructor: Dr. Stefan Wuchty, Fall 2015

"If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."

This class will introduce the student to using commands on the terminal, 
creating shellscripts, and basic C functions and libraries.

NOTE: Please refrain from copying code. Try to work out the lab tasks. 
If you're stuck, ask the TA for help. Else if that doesn't work, search for 
answers to your specific problem on Stack Overflow or StackExchange. Else, 
post a question on those sites. 

CSC120 and CSC220 focused on object oriented programming in Java. 
C is radically different: it has no "objects". And there is no IDE like
Eclipse that compiles and executes files for you. Here, code must be compiled
and executables launched via the command line. Little changes to get used to. 
After a while, you'll find that the command line creates, deletes, and finds 
files faster than a graphical interface can. 

This class can be pretty funny at times. Some of the command names remind us that
the UNIX gurus were just like us at some point: hormone-driven teens who enjoyed
a tinge of lewd humor. 

Good Luck! Make the most of your college experience.
